  "text": "Amazon EC2 instance types\nEnd of sale notice\nThe U-9tb1, U-12tb1, U-18tb1, and U-24tb1 instance types are no longer available for new instance launches. If your workload requires a high-memory instance, we recommend that you use a U7i instance type instead.\nWhen you launch an EC2 instance, the instance type that you specify determines the hardware of the host computer used for your instance. Each instance type offers different compute, memory, and storage capabilities, and is grouped in an instance family based on these capabilities. Select an instance type based on the requirements of the application or software that you plan to run on your instance.\nAmazon EC2 dedicates some resources of the host computer, such as CPU, memory, and instance storage, to a particular instance. Amazon EC2 shares other resources of the host computer, such as the network and the disk subsystem, among instances. If each instance on a host computer tries to use as much of one of these shared resources as possible, each receives an equal share of that resource. However, when a resource is underused, an instance can consume a higher share of that resource while it's available.\nEach instance type provides higher or lower minimum performance from a shared resource. For example, instance types with high I/O performance have a larger allocation of shared resources. Allocating a larger share of shared resources also reduces the variance of I/O performance. For most applications, moderate I/O performance is more than enough. However, for applications that require greater or more consistent I/O performance, consider an instance type with higher I/O performance.\nFor pricing information, see Amazon EC2 Pricing\nCurrent generation instances\nFor the best performance, we recommend that you use the following instance types\nwhen you launch new instances.

We encourage you to use current generation\ninstance types to get the best performance, but we continue to support the following previous\ngeneration instance types. For more information about which current\ngeneration instance type would be a suitable upgrade, see\nPrevious Generation Instances\n-\nGeneral purpose: A1 | M1 | M2 | M3 | M4 | T1\n-\nCompute optimized: C1 | C3 | C4\n-\nMemory optimized: R3 | R4\n-\nStorage optimized: I2\n-\nAccelerated computing: G3\nInstance performance\nFixed performance instances\nFixed performance instances provide fixed CPU resources. These instances can deliver and sustain full CPU performance at any time, and for as long as a workload needs it. If you need consistently high CPU performance for applications such as video encoding, high volume websites, or HPC applications, we recommend that you use fixed performance instances.\nBurstable performance instances\nBurstable performance (\nT) instances provide a baseline level of CPU\nperformance with the ability to burst above the baseline. The baseline CPU is\ndesigned to meet the needs of the majority of general purpose workloads, such as\nlarge-scale micro-services, web servers, small and medium databases, data logging,\ncode repositories, virtual desktops, and development and test environments.\nThe baseline utilization and ability to burst are governed by CPU credits. Each burstable performance instance continuously earns credits when it stays below the CPU baseline, and continuously spends credits when it bursts above the baseline. For more information, see Burstable performance instances in the Amazon EC2 User Guide.\nFlex instances\nM7i-flex and C7i-flex instances offer a balance of compute, memory, and network resources, and they provide the most cost-effective way to run a broad spectrum of general purpose applications. These instances provide reliable CPU resources to deliver a baseline CPU performance of 40 percent, which is designed to meet the compute requirements for a majority of general purpose workloads. When more performance is needed, these instances provide the ability to exceed the baseline CPU performance and deliver up to 100 percent CPU performance for 95 percent of the time over a 24-hour window.\nM7i-flex and C7i-flex instances running at a high CPU utilization that is consistently\nabove the baseline for long periods of time might see a gradual reduction in the maximum\nburst CPU throughput.
