With the .NET transformation agent, modernization teams can collaboratively deliver larger and more complex projects with consistency, remove Windows license dependencies to reduce operating costs by up to 40%, and enhance code quality, performance and security.\nMainframe\nAWS Transform for mainframe can accelerate modernization of IBM z/OS applications from years to months . The specialized mainframe agent streamlines the entire mainframe transformation process —from initial analysis and planning to code refactoring and migration—accelerating modernization timelines and reducing ongoing mainframe costs.\nVMware\nAWS Transform for VMware helps you save on VMware licensing costs and drive innovation by modernizing your workloads to Amazon EC2. The VMware agent automates application discovery and dependency mapping, network translation, wave planning, while optimizing Amazon EC2 instance selection to accelerate VMware workload modernization.\nToyota Motor North America\n\"Toyota Motor North America faces challenges of updating 40- year-old mainframe applications that support a majority of our supply chain. The transformation capabilities of [AWS Transform] have been a revolutionary solution for us. The powerful documentation, code analysis, and decomposition capabilities provided by AWS give us a clearer understanding of our application landscape. We’re able to generate detailed documentation of hundreds of COBOL modules, including context-aware information and persona-driven insights, in less than a day. [AWS Transform] has done what many said was impossible.\"\nThomson Reuters\n\"AWS Transform felt like an extension of our team — constantly learning, optimizing, and helping us move faster.\""
