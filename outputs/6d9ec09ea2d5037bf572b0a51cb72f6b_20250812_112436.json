Millions of customers of all sizes and industries store, manage, analyze, and protect any amount of data for virtually any use case, such as data lakes, cloud-native applications, and mobile apps. With cost-effective storage classes and easy-to-use management features, you can optimize costs, organize and analyze data, and configure fine-tuned access controls to meet specific business and compliance requirements.\nBenefits\nScalability\nYou can store virtually any amount of data with S3 all the way to exabytes with unmatched performance. S3 is fully elastic, automatically growing and shrinking as you add and remove data. There’s no need to provision storage, and you pay only for what you use.\nDurability and availability\nAmazon S3 provides the most durable storage in the cloud and industry leading availability. Based on its unique architecture, S3 is designed to provide 99.999999999% (11 nines) data durability and 99.99% availability by default, backed by the strongest SLAs in the cloud.\nSecurity and data protection\nProtect your data with unmatched security, data protection, compliance, and access control capabilities. S3 is secure, private, and encrypted by default, and also supports numerous auditing capabilities to monitor access requests to your S3 resources.\nLowest price and highest performance\nS3 delivers multiple storage classes with the best price performance for any workload and automated data lifecycle management, so you can store massive amounts of frequently, infrequently, or rarely accessed data in a cost-efficient way. S3 delivers the resiliency, flexibility, latency, and throughput, to ensure storage never limits performance.\nUse cases\nBuild a data lake\nA data lake is a centralized repository that allows you to store all your structured and unstructured data at any scale. You can run data analytics, artificial intelligence (AI), machine learning (ML), and high-performance computing (HPC) applications to unlock the value of your data.\n- With an Amazon S3 data lake, users in Salesforce’s organization can discover, access, and analyze all their data, regardless of where it lives, in a secure and governed way.\nBackup and restore critical data\nMeet your recovery time objective (RTO), recovery point objective (RPO), and compliance requirements with S3's robust replication functionality, data protection with AWS Backup, and various AWS Partner Network solutions.\n-\nAncestry uses the Amazon S3 Glacier storage classes to restore terabytes of images in mere hours instead of days.\nArchive data at the lowest cost\nMove data archives to the Amazon S3 Glacier storage classes to lower costs, eliminate operational complexities, and gain new insights.\n- The BBC, a UK public service broadcaster, safely migrated its 100-year-old flagship archive to Amazon S3 Glacier Instant Retrieval.\nPut your data to work\nBecause Amazon S3 stores more than 350 trillion objects (exabytes of data) for virtually any use case and averages over 100 million requests per second, it may be the starting point of your generative AI journey.\n-\nGrendene is creating a generative AI-based virtual assistant for their sales team using a data lake built on Amazon S3.\nIndustry-leading scalability\nCost savings\nSeamless integration\nA cornerstone solution\nHow it works\nAmazon S3 stores data as objects within buckets. An object is a file and any metadata that describes the file. A bucket is a container for objects. To store your data in Amazon S3, you first create a bucket and specify a bucket name and AWS Region. Then, you upload your data to that bucket as objects in Amazon S3. Each object has a key (or key name), which is the unique identifier for the object within the bucket.\nS3 provides features that you can configure to support your specific use case. For example, you can use S3 Versioning to keep multiple versions of an object in the same bucket, which allows you to restore objects that are accidentally deleted or overwritten. Buckets and the objects in them are private and can only be accessed with explicitly granted access permissions. You can use bucket policies, AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) policies, S3 Access Points, and access control lists (ACLs) to manage access.\nDid you find what you were looking for today?\nLet us know so we can improve the quality of the content on our pages"
