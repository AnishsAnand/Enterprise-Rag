  "text": "Deploy and manage containers on Amazon Lightsail\nAn Amazon Lightsail container service is a highly scalable compute and networking resource on which you can deploy, run, and manage containers. A container is a standard unit of software that packages code and its dependencies together so the application runs quickly and reliably from one computing environment to another.\nYou can think of your Lightsail container service as a computing environment that lets you run containers on AWS infrastructure by using images that you create on your local machine and push to your service, or images from an online repository, like Amazon ECR Public Gallery.\nYou can also run containers locally, on your local machine, by installing software such as Docker. Amazon Elastic Container Service (Amazon ECS) and Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) are other resources within the AWS infrastructure on which you can run containers. For more information, see the Amazon ECS Developer Guide.\nContents\nContainers\nA container is a standard unit of software that packages code and its dependencies together so the application runs quickly and reliably from one computing environment to another. You could run a container on your development environment, deploy it to your pre-production environment, and then deploy it to your production environment. Your containers will run reliably regardless of whether your development environment is your local machine, your pre-production environment is a physical server in a data center, or your production environment is a virtual private server in the cloud.\nA container image is a lightweight, standalone, executable package of software that includes everything needed to run an application: code, runtime, system tools, system libraries and settings. Container images become containers at runtime. By containerizing the application and its dependencies, you no longer have to worry about whether your software runs correctly on the operating system and infrastructure that you deploy it on – you can spend more time focusing on the code.\nFor more information about containers, and container images, see What is a Container?\nLightsail container service elements\nThe following are the key elements of Lightsail container services that you should understand before getting started.\nLightsail container services\nA container service is the Lightsail compute resource that you can create in any AWS Region in which Lightsail is available. You can create and delete container services at any time. For more information, see Create Lightsail container services and Delete Lightsail container services.\nContainer service capacity (scale and power)\nYou must choose the following capacity parameters when you first create your container service:\n-\nScale — The number of compute nodes that you want your container workload to run in. Your container workload is copied across the compute nodes of your service. You can specify up to 20 compute nodes for a container service. You pick the scale based on the number of nodes you want powering your service for better availability and higher capacity. Traffic to your containers will be load-balanced across all nodes.\n-\nPower — The memory and vCPUs of each node in your container service. The powers that you can choose are Nano (Na), Micro (Mi), Small (Sm), Medium (Md), Large (Lg), and Xlarge (Xl), each with a progressively greater amount of memory and vCPUs.\nIf you specify the scale of your container service as more than 1, then your container workload is copied across the multiple compute nodes of your service. For example, if the scale of your service is 3 and the power is Nano, then there are three copies of your container workload running on three compute resources each with 512 MB of RAM and 0.25 vCPUs. The incoming traffic is load-balanced between the three resources. The greater the capacity you specify for your container service, the more traffic it is able to handle.\nYou can dynamically increase the power and scale of your container service at any time without any down-time if you find that it's under-provisioned, or decrease it if you find that it's over-provisioned. Lightsail automatically manages the capacity change along with your current deployment. For more information, see Change the capacity of your container service.\nPricing\nThe monthly price of your container service is calculated by multiplying the price of its power with the number of its compute nodes (the scale of your service). For example, a service with a medium power, which has a price of $40 USD, and a scale of 3 compute nodes, will cost $120 USD per month. You are charged for your container service whether it's enabled or disabled, and whether it has a deployment or not. You must delete your container service to stop being charged for it.\nEach container service, regardless of its configured capacity, includes a monthly data\ntransfer quota of 500 GB. The data transfer quota does not change regardless of the power\nand scale that you choose for your service. Data transfer out to the internet in excess of\nthe quota will result in an overage charge that varies by AWS Region and starts at $0.09\nUSD per GB. Data transfer in from the internet in excess of the quota does not incur an\noverage charge. For more information, see the Lightsail pricing page\nDeployments\nYou can create a deployment in your Lightsail container service. A deployment is a set of specifications for the container workload that you wish to launch on your service.\nYou can specify the following parameters for each container entry in a deployment:\n-\nThe name of your container that will be launched\n-\nThe source container image to use for your container\n-\nThe command to run when launching your container\n-\nThe environment variables to apply to your container\n-\nThe network ports to open on your container\n-\nThe container in the deployment to make publicly accessible through the default domain of the container service\nNote\nOnly one container in a deployment can be made publicly accessible for each container service.\nThe following health check parameters will apply to the public endpoint of a deployment after it's launched:\n-\nThe directory path on which to perform a health check.\n-\nAdvanced health check settings, such as interval seconds, timeout seconds, success codes, healthy threshold, and unhealthy threshold.\nYour container service can have one active deployment at a time, and a deployment can have up to 10 container entries. You can create a deployment at the same time as you create your container service, or you can create it after your service is up and running. For more information, see Create and manage container service deployments.\nDeployment versions\nEvery deployment that you create in your container service is saved as a deployment version. If you modify the parameters of an existing deployment, the containers are re-deployed to your service and the modified deployment results in a new deployment version. The latest 50 deployment versions for each container service are saved. You can use any of the 50 deployment versions to create a new deployment in the same container service. For more information, see Create and manage container service deployments.\nContainer image sources\nWhen you create a deployment, you must specify a source container image for each container entry in your deployment. Immediately after you create your deployment, your container service pulls the images from the sources you specify and uses them to create your containers.\nThe images that you specify can originate from the following sources:\n-\nA public registry, such as Amazon ECR Public Gallery, or some other public container image registry. For more information about Amazon ECR Public, see What Is Amazon Elastic Container Registry Public? in the Amazon ECR Public User Guide.\n-\nImages pushed from your local machine to your container service. If you create container images on your local machine, you can push them to your container service to use them when creating a deployment. For more information, see Create container service images and Push and manage container images.\nLightsail container services support Linux-based container images. Windows-based container images are currently not supported, but you can run Docker, the AWS Command Line Interface (AWS CLI), and the Lightsail Control (lightsailctl) plugin on Windows to build and push your Linux based images to your Lightsail container service.\nContainer service ARN\nAmazon Resource Names (ARNs) uniquely identify AWS resources. We require an ARN when you need to specify a resource unambiguously across all of AWS, such as in IAM policies, and API calls.\nTo get the ARN for your container service, use the\nGetContainerServices\nLightsail API action, and specify the name of the container service using the\nserviceName parameter. Your container service ARN will be listed in the\nresults of that action as shown in the following example. For more information, see GetContainerServices in the Amazon Lightsail API\nReference.\nYou will see output similar to the following:\n{ \"containerServices\": [ { \"containerServiceName\": \"container-service-1\", \"arn\": \"arn:aws:lightsail: :111122223333:ContainerService/a1b2c3d4-5678-90ab-cdef-EXAMPLE11111\", \"createdAt\": \"2024-01-01T00:00:00+00:00\", \"location\": { \"availabilityZone\": \"all\", \"regionName\": \"us-west-2\" }, ..... }\nPublic endpoints and default domains\nWhen you create a deployment, you can specify the container entry in the deployment that\nwill serve as the public endpoint of your container service. The application on the public\nendpoint container is publicly accessible on the internet through a randomly generated\ndefault domain of your container service. The default domain is formatted as\nhttps://,\nin which\n<ServiceName>.\n<RandomGUID>.\n<AWSRegion>.cs.amazonlightsail.com\n<ServiceName> is the name of your container\nservice,\n<RandomGUID> is a randomly generated globally\nunique identifier of your container service in the AWS Region for your Lightsail\naccount, and\n<AWSRegion> is the AWS Region in which the\ncontainer service was created. The public endpoint of Lightsail container services\nsupports HTTPS only, and it does not support TCP or UDP traffic. Only one container can be\nthe public endpoint for a service. So make sure that choose the container that is hosting\nthe front-end of your application as the public endpoint while rest of the containers are\ninternally accessible.\nYou can use the default domain of your container service, or you can use your own custom domain (your registered domain name). For more information about using custom domains with your container services, see Enable and manage custom domains for your container services.\nPrivate domain\nAll container services also have a private domain that is formatted as\n, in which\n<ServiceName>.service.local\n<ServiceName> is the name of your container service. Use\nthe private domain to access your container service from another one of your Lightsail\nresources in the same AWS Region as your service. The private domain is the only way to\naccess your container service if you don't specify a public endpoint in the deployment of\nyour service. A default domain is generated for your container service even if you don't\nspecify a public endpoint, but it will show a\n404 No Such Service error message\nwhen you try to browse to it.\nTo access a specific container using the private domain of your container service, you\nmust specify the open port of the container that will accept your connection request. You do\nthis by formatting the domain of your request as\n,\nin which\n<ServiceName>.service.local:\n<PortNumber>\n<ServiceName> is the name of your container\nservice and\n<PortNumber> is the open port of the container\nthat you wish to connect to. For example, if you create a deployment on your container\nservice named\ncontainer-service-1, and you specify a Redis container with port\n6379 open, then you should format the domain of your request as\n.\ncontainer-service-1.service.local:\n6379\nCustom domains and SSL/TLS certificates\nYou can use up to 4 of your custom domains with your container service instead of using\nthe default domain. For example, you can direct traffic for your custom domain, such as\nexample.com, to the container in your deployment that is labeled as the\npublic endpoint.\nTo use your custom domains with your service, you must first request an SSL/TLS certificate for the domains that you want to use. You must then validate the SSL/TLS certificate by adding a set of CNAME records to the DNS of your domains. After the SSL/TLS certificate is validated, you enable custom domains on your container service by attaching the valid SSL/TLS certificate to your service. For more information see Create SSL/TLS certificates for your Lightsail container services, Validate SSL/TLS certificates for your Lightsail container services, and Enable and manage custom domains for your Lightsail container services.\nContainer logs\nEvery container in your container service generates a log that you can access to diagnose the operation of your containers. The logs provide the stdout and stderr streams of processes that run inside the container. For more information, see View container service logs.\nMetrics\nMonitor the metrics of your container service to diagnose issues that may be a result of over-utilization. You can also monitor metrics to help you determine if your service is under-provisioned or over-provisioned. For more information, see View container service metrics.\nUse Lightsail container services\nThe following are the general steps to manage your Lightsail container service and either push images from your local machine to your service or use container images from a public registry.\nTo manage your Lightsail container service and use container images in your deployment\n-\nCreate your container service in your Lightsail account. For more information, see Create Lightsail container services.\n-\nUse one of the following options to use container images with your Lightsail container service:\n-\nUse a container image from your local machine – You can install software on your local machine to create your own container images, and then push them to your Lightsail container service. For more information, see the following guides:\n-\nUse a container image from a public registry – You can find and use container images for your Lightsail container service from a public registry such as the Amazon ECR Public Gallery. For more information about the Amazon ECR Public Gallery, see What Is Amazon Elastic Container Registry Public? in the Amazon ECR Public User Guide.\n-\n-\nInstall software to manage container images for your Lightsail container services.\n-\nCreate container images for your Lightsail container services.\n-\nPush and manage container images on your Lightsail container services.\n-\nCreate a deployment in your container service that configures and launches your containers.

You can create a new deployment using a previous deployment version. For more information, see View and manage deployment versions of your Lightsail container services.\n-\nView the logs of containers on your container service. For more information, see View the container logs of your Lightsail container services.\n-\nCreate an SSL/TLS certificate for the domains that you want to use with your containers. For more information, see Create SSL/TLS certificates for your Lightsail container services.\n-\nValidate the SSL/TLS certificate by adding records to the DNS of your domains. For more information, see Validate SSL/TLS certificates for your Lightsail container services.\n-\nEnable custom domains by attaching a valid SSL/TLS certificate to your container service. For more information, see Enable and manage custom domains for your Lightsail container services.\n-\nMonitor the utilization metrics of your container service. For more information, see View container service metrics.\n-\n(Optional) Scale the capacity of your container service vertically, by increasing its power specification, and horizontally, by increasing its scale specification. For more information, see Change the capacity of your Lightsail container services.\n-\nDelete your container service if you're not using it to avoid incurring monthly charges.
