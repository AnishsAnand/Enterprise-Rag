Serverless technologies feature automatic scaling, built-in high availability, and a pay-for-use billing model to increase agility and optimize costs. These technologies also eliminate infrastructure management tasks like capacity provisioning and patching, so you can focus on writing code that serves your customers.\nBenefits of Serverless on AWS\nMove from idea to market, faster\nLower your costs\nAdapt at scale\nBuild better applications, easier\nServerless services on AWS\nModern applications are built serverless-first, a strategy that prioritizes the adoption of serverless services, so you can increase agility throughout your application stack. We’ve developed serverless services for all three layers of your stack: compute, integration, and data stores. Consider getting started with these services:\nUse cases\nBuild web applications\nBuild a simple “to-do list” web app that enables a registered user to create, update, view, and delete items. An event-driven web application may use AWS Lambda and Amazon API Gateway for its business logic and Amazon DynamoDB as its database, and AWS Amplify Console to host all static content.\nProcess data at nearly any scale\nDeliver notes from an interview in Markdown format to Amazon S3. Use S3 Events to trigger multiple processing flows - one to convert and persist Markdown files to HTML and another to detect and persist sentiment.\nAutomate batch processing\nSchedule workflows on a recurring basis using an Amazon EventBridge rule. For example, you can generate the minimum, maximum, and average ratings for air quality measurements by orchestrating the Extract Transfer Load (ETL) workflow using AWS Step Functions and AWS Lambda.\nIndex and store documents and images automatically\nUse Amazon machine learning (ML) services like Amazon Comprehend and Amazon Rekognition to uncover information in unstructured data and send the results to Amazon OpenSearch (successor to Amazon Elasticsearch Service) for fast indexing. Patterns like this work well in ecommerce applications for tasks that support personalized customer experiences, such as clickstream analysis.\nGet started with serverless on AWS\nDid you find what you were looking for today?\nLet us know so we can improve the quality of the content on our pages"
