We recommend using your personal email for your Builder ID, but you can use the same email for your Builder ID and for the root user email of an AWS account. An AWS account is a resource container with contact and payment information. It establishes a security boundary in which to operate billed and metered AWS services, like S3, EC2, or Lambda. Account owners can sign in to an AWS account in the AWS Management Console.\nWhere do I find my Builder Center alias?\nYou can find your alias on your AWS Builder Center profile page.\nWhere do I find my personalized Builder Center url?\nYou can find your personalized url on your AWS Builder Center profile page."
