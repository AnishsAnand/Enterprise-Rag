With EKS, you can:\n-\nDeploy applications faster with less operational overhead\n-\nScale seamlessly to meet changing workload demands\n-\nImprove security through AWS integration and automated updates\n-\nChoose between standard EKS or fully automated EKS Auto Mode\nAmazon Elastic Kubernetes Service (Amazon EKS) is the premiere platform for running Kubernetes\nAmazon EKS simplifies building, securing, and maintaining Kubernetes clusters. It can be more cost effective at providing enough resources to meet peak demand than maintaining your own data centers. Two of the main approaches to using Amazon EKS are as follows:\n-\nEKS standard: AWS manages the Kubernetes control plane\nwhen you create a cluster with EKS. Components that manage nodes, schedule workloads, integrate with the AWS cloud, and store and scale control plane information to keep your clusters up and running, are handled for you automatically.\n-\nEKS Auto Mode: Using the EKS Auto Mode feature, EKS extends its control to manage Nodes\n(Kubernetes data plane) as well. It simplifies Kubernetes management by automatically provisioning infrastructure, selecting optimal compute instances, dynamically scaling resources, continuously optimizing costs, patching operating systems, and integrating with AWS security services.\nThe following diagram illustrates how Amazon EKS integrates your Kubernetes clusters with the AWS cloud, depending on which method of cluster creation you choose:\nAmazon EKS helps you accelerate time to production, improve performance, availability and resiliency, and enhance system security.\nFor more information, see Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service\nFeatures of Amazon EKS\nAmazon EKS provides the following high-level features:\n- Management interfaces\n-\nEKS offers multiple interfaces to provision, manage, and maintain clusters, including AWS Management Console, Amazon EKS API/SDKs, CDK, AWS CLI, eksctl CLI, AWS CloudFormation, and Terraform. For more information, see Get started with Amazon EKS and Amazon EKS cluster lifecycle and configuration.\n- Access control tools\n-\nEKS relies on both Kubernetes and AWS Identity and Access Management (AWS IAM) features to manage access from users and workloads. For more information, see Grant IAM users and roles access to Kubernetes APIs and Grant Kubernetes workloads access to AWS using Kubernetes Service Accounts.\n- Compute resources\n-\nFor compute resources, EKS allows the full range of Amazon EC2 instance types and AWS innovations such as Nitro and Graviton with Amazon EKS for you to optimize the compute for your workloads. For more information, see Manage compute resources by using nodes.\n- Storage\n-\nEKS Auto Mode automatically creates storage classes using EBS volumes. Using Container Storage Interface (CSI) drivers, you can also use Amazon S3, Amazon EFS, Amazon FSX, and Amazon File Cache for your application storage needs. For more information, see Use application data storage for your cluster.\n- Security\n-\nThe shared responsibility model is employed as it relates to Security in Amazon EKS. For more information, see Security best practices, Infrastructure security, and Kubernetes security.\n- Monitoring tools\n-\nUse the observability dashboard to monitor Amazon EKS clusters. Monitoring tools include Prometheus, CloudWatch, Cloudtrail, and ADOT Operator. For more information on dashboards, metrics servers, and other tools, see EKS cluster costs and Kubernetes Metrics Server.\n- Kubernetes compatibility and support\n-\nAmazon EKS is certified Kubernetes-conformant, so you can deploy Kubernetes-compatible applications without refactoring and use Kubernetes community tooling and plugins. EKS offers both standard support and eks/latest/userguide/kubernetes-versions-extended.html[extended support,type=\"documentation\"] for Kubernetes. For more information, see eks/latest/userguide/kubernetes-versions.html[Understand the Kubernetes version lifecycle on EKS,type=\"documentation\"].\nRelated services\nServices to use with Amazon EKS\nYou can use other AWS services with the clusters that you deploy using Amazon EKS:\n- Amazon EC2\n-\nObtain on-demand, scalable compute capacity with Amazon EC2.\n- Amazon EBS\n-\nAttach scalable, high-performance block storage resources with Amazon EBS.\n- Amazon ECR\n-\nStore container images securely with Amazon ECR.\n- Amazon CloudWatch\n-\nMonitor AWS resources and applications in real time with Amazon CloudWatch.\n- Amazon Prometheus\n-\nTrack metrics for containerized applications with Amazon Managed Service for Prometheus.\n- Elastic Load Balancing\n-\nDistribute incoming traffic across multiple targets with Elastic Load Balancing.\n- Amazon GuardDuty\n-\nDetect threats to EKS clusters with Amazon GuardDuty.\n- AWS Resilience Hub\n-\nAssess EKS cluster resiliency with AWS Resilience Hub.\nAmazon EKS Pricing\nAmazon EKS has per cluster pricing based on Kubernetes cluster version support, pricing for Amazon EKS Auto Mode, and per vCPU pricing for Amazon EKS Hybrid Nodes.\nWhen using Amazon EKS, you pay separately for the AWS resources you use to run your applications on Kubernetes worker nodes. For example, if you are running Kubernetes worker nodes as Amazon EC2 instances with Amazon EBS volumes and public IPv4 addresses, you are charged for the instance capacity through Amazon EC2, the volume capacity through Amazon EBS, and the IPv4 address through Amazon VPC.\nVisit the respective pricing pages of the AWS services you are using with your Kubernetes applications for detailed pricing information.\n-\nFor Amazon EKS cluster, Amazon EKS Auto Mode, and Amazon EKS Hybrid Nodes pricing, see Amazon EKS Pricing\n.\n-\nFor Amazon EC2 pricing, see Amazon EC2 On-Demand Pricing\nand Amazon EC2 Spot Pricing .\n-\nFor AWS Fargate pricing, see AWS Fargate Pricing\n.\n-\nYou can use your savings plans for compute used in Amazon EKS clusters.
