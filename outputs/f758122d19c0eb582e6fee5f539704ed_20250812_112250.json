Collaborate and build faster from a unified studio using familiar AWS tools for model development in SageMaker AI (including HyperPod, JumpStart, and MLOps), generative AI, data processing, and SQL analytics, accelerated by Amazon Q Developer, the most capable generative AI assistant for software development. Access all your data whether it’s stored in data lakes, data warehouses, or third-party or federated data sources, with governance built in to meet enterprise security needs.\nBenefits\nDevelop and scale AI models with SageMaker AI (formerly Amazon SageMaker)\nAccelerate AI in SageMaker with a comprehensive set of AI development capabilities that are secure by design. Train, customize, and deploy ML and foundation models (FMs) on a highly performant and cost-effective infrastructure. Use purpose-built tools spanning the entire AI lifecycle— from high-performance integrated development environments (IDEs) and distributed training to inference, AI ops, governance, and observability. Rapidly create generative AI applications tailored to your business with cutting-edge models and your proprietary data. Speed up AI development with Amazon Q Developer, helping you more easily discover data, build and train ML models, generate SQL queries, and create and run data pipeline jobs, all through natural language.\nBuild with all your tools for analytics and AI in SageMaker Unified Studio\nAmazon SageMaker Unified Studio provides an integrated experience to use all your data and tools for analytics and AI. Discover your data and put it to work using familiar AWS tools for model development, generative AI, data processing, and SQL analytics. Work across compute resources using unified notebooks, discover and query diverse data sources with a built-in SQL editor, train and deploy AI models at scale, and rapidly build custom generative AI applications. Create and securely share analytics and AI artifacts such as data, models, and generative AI applications to bring data products to market faster.\nReduce data silos and unify all your data with a lakehouse architecture\nUnify all your data across Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3) data lakes and Amazon Redshift data warehouses with a lakehouse architecture in Amazon SageMaker. Gain the flexibility to access and query your data with all Apache Iceberg–compatible tools and engines on a single copy of analytics data. Secure your data by defining fine-grained permissions, applied across your analytics and AI tools in the lakehouse. Bring data from operational databases and applications into your lakehouse in near real time through zero-ETL integrations. Additionally, access and query data in place with federated query capabilities across third-party data sources.\nMeet your enterprise security needs with end-to-end data and AI governance\nEnsure enterprise security with built-in governance throughout the entire data and AI lifecycle. SageMaker empowers you to control access to the right data, models, and development artifacts by the right user for the right purpose. Consistently define and enforce access policies using a single permission model with fine-grained access controls with Amazon SageMaker Catalog. Safeguard and protect your AI models with data classification, toxicity detection, guardrails, and responsible AI policies. Gain trust throughout your organization through data-quality monitoring and automation, sensitive data detection, and data and ML lineage.\nMeet the next generation of SageMaker\nCapabilities of SageMaker Unified Studio\nSee the next generation of Amazon SageMaker in action\nExplore the interactive demo experience below\nCustomers\nToyota\n\"To address siloed data sets spread across our automotive operations, we are implementing Amazon SageMaker to help unify and govern data across our connected car, sales, manufacturing, and supply chain units. This approach allows us to search, discover, and share data effortlessly, laying the groundwork to pre-empt quality issues, increase customer satisfaction, and enable easier development of generative AI applications.\"\nKamal Distell, VP of Data, Analytics, Platforms, and Data Science, TMNA\nCharter Communications\nWith Amazon SageMaker Unified Studio, you have a one stop shop to interact with various AWS Services, [including] Redshift and SageMaker Lakehouse. It makes the developer experience that much better and improves speed to market because you don’t need to jump across multiple services. Features like Amazon Q Developer are very exciting and we want to explore it further to see how it will help us improve our developer productivity, speed to market, and build better quality solutions.\nSenthil Sugumar, Group VP, Business Intelligence, Charter Communications\nLennar\n\"We have spent the last 18 months working with AWS to transform our data foundation to use best-in-class solutions that are cost effective as well. With advancements like Amazon SageMaker Unified Studio and Amazon SageMaker Lakehouse, we are accelerating our velocity of delivery through seamless access to data and services, thus enabling our engineers, analysts, and scientists to surface insights that provide material value to our business.\"\nLee Slezak, SVP of Data and Analytic, Lennar\nCarrier\n\"At Carrier, the next generation of Amazon SageMaker is transforming our enterprise data strategy by streamlining how we build and scale data products. SageMaker Unified Studio’s approach to data discovery, processing, and model development has significantly accelerated our lakehouse implementation. Most impressively, its seamless integration with our existing data catalog and built-in governance controls enables us to democratize data access while maintaining security standards, helping our teams rapidly deliver advanced analytics and AI solutions across the enterprise.\"\nJustin McDowell, Director of Data Platform & Data Engineering, Carrier\nNatWest Group\n\"Our Data Platform Engineering team has been deploying multiple end-user tools for data engineering, ML, SQL, and gen AI tasks. As we look to simplify processes across the bank, we’ve been looking at streamlining user authentication and data access authorization. Amazon SageMaker delivers a ready-made user experience to help us deploy one single environment across the organization, reducing the time required for our data users to access new tools by around 50%.\"\nZachery Anderson, CDAO, NatWest Group\nDid you find what you were looking for today?\nLet us know so we can improve the quality of the content on our pages"
