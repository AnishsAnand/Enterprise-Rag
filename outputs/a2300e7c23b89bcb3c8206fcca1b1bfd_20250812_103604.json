  "text": "What is Amazon EC2?\nAmazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) provides on-demand, scalable computing capacity in the Amazon Web Services (AWS) Cloud. Using Amazon EC2 reduces hardware costs so you can develop and deploy applications faster. You can use Amazon EC2 to launch as many or as few virtual servers as you need, configure security and networking, and manage storage. You can add capacity (scale up) to handle compute-heavy tasks, such as monthly or yearly processes, or spikes in website traffic. When usage decreases, you can reduce capacity (scale down) again.\nAn EC2 instance is a virtual server in the AWS Cloud. When you launch an EC2 instance, the instance type that you specify determines the hardware available to your instance. Each instance type offers a different balance of compute, memory, network, and storage resources. For more information, see the Amazon EC2 Instance Types Guide.\nFeatures of Amazon EC2\nAmazon EC2 provides the following high-level features:\n- Instances\n-\nVirtual servers.\n- Amazon Machine Images (AMIs)\n-\nPreconfigured templates for your instances that package the components you need for your server (including the operating system and additional software).\n- Instance types\n-\nVarious configurations of CPU, memory, storage, networking capacity, and graphics hardware for your instances.\n- Amazon EBS volumes\n-\nPersistent storage volumes for your data using Amazon Elastic Block Store (Amazon EBS).\n- Instance store volumes\n-\nStorage volumes for temporary data that is deleted when you stop, hibernate, or terminate your instance.\n- Key pairs\n-\nSecure login information for your instances. AWS stores the public key and you store the private key in a secure place.\n- Security groups\n-\nA virtual firewall that allows you to specify the protocols, ports, and source IP ranges that can reach your instances, and the destination IP ranges to which your instances can connect.\nAmazon EC2 supports the processing, storage, and transmission\nof credit card data by a merchant or service provider, and has been\nvalidated as being compliant with Payment Card Industry (PCI) Data Security Standard (DSS).\nFor more information about PCI DSS, including how to request a copy of the AWS PCI Compliance Package,\nsee PCI DSS Level 1\nRelated services\nServices to use with Amazon EC2\nYou can use other AWS services with the instances that you deploy using Amazon EC2.\n- Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling\n-\nHelps ensure you have the correct number of Amazon EC2 instances available to handle the load for your application.\n- AWS Backup\n-\nAutomate backing up your Amazon EC2 instances and the Amazon EBS volumes attached to them.\n- Amazon CloudWatch\n-\nMonitor your instances and Amazon EBS volumes.\n- Elastic Load Balancing\n-\nAutomatically distribute incoming application traffic across multiple instances.\n- Amazon GuardDuty\n-\nDetect potentially unauthorized or malicious use of your EC2 instances.\n- EC2 Image Builder\n-\nAutomate the creation, management, and deployment of customized, secure, and up-to-date server images.\n- AWS Launch Wizard\n-\nSize, configure, and deploy AWS resources for third-party applications without having to manually identify and provision individual AWS resources.\n- AWS Systems Manager\n-\nPerform operations at scale on EC2 instances with this secure end-to-end management solution.\nAdditional compute services\nYou can launch instances using another AWS compute service instead of using Amazon EC2.\n- Amazon Lightsail\n-\nBuild websites or web applications using Amazon Lightsail, a cloud platform that provides the resources that you need to deploy your project quickly, for a low, predictable monthly price. To compare Amazon EC2 and Lightsail, see Amazon Lightsail or Amazon EC2.\n- Amazon Elastic Container Service (Amazon ECS)\n-\nDeploy, manage, and scale containerized applications on a cluster of EC2 instances. For more information, see Choosing an AWS container service.\n- Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service (Amazon EKS)\n-\nRun your Kubernetes applications on AWS. For more information, see Choosing an AWS container service.\nAccess Amazon EC2\nYou can create and manage your Amazon EC2 instances using the following interfaces:\n- Amazon EC2 console\n-\nA simple web interface to create and manage Amazon EC2 instances and resources. If you've signed up for an AWS account, you can access the Amazon EC2 console by signing into the AWS Management Console and selecting EC2 from the console home page.\n- AWS Command Line Interface\n-\nEnables you to interact with AWS services using commands in your command-line shell. It is supported on Windows, Mac, and Linux. For more information about the AWS CLI , see AWS Command Line Interface User Guide. You can find the Amazon EC2 commands in the AWS CLI Command Reference\n.\n- AWS CloudFormation\n-\nAmazon EC2 supports creating resources using AWS CloudFormation. You create a template, in JSON or YAML format, that describes your AWS resources, and AWS CloudFormation provisions and configures those resources for you. You can reuse your CloudFormation templates to provision the same resources multiple times, whether in the same Region and account or in multiple Regions and accounts. For more information about supported resource types and properties for Amazon EC2, see EC2 resource type reference in the AWS CloudFormation User Guide.\n- AWS SDKs\n-\nIf you prefer to build applications using language-specific APIs instead of submitting a request over HTTP or HTTPS, AWS provides libraries, sample code, tutorials, and other resources for software developers. These libraries provide basic functions that automate tasks such as cryptographically signing your requests, retrying requests, and handling error responses, making it easier for you to get started. For more information, see Tools to Build on AWS\n.\n- AWS Tools for PowerShell\n-\nA set of PowerShell modules that are built on the functionality exposed by the SDK for .NET. The Tools for PowerShell enable you to script operations on your AWS resources from the PowerShell command line. To get started, see the AWS Tools for PowerShell User Guide. You can find the cmdlets for Amazon EC2, in the AWS Tools for PowerShell Cmdlet Reference.\n- Query API\n-\nAmazon EC2 provides a Query API. These requests are HTTP or HTTPS requests that use the HTTP verbs GET or POST and a Query parameter named\nAction. For more information about the API actions for Amazon EC2, see Actions in the Amazon EC2 API Reference.\nPricing for Amazon EC2\nAmazon EC2 provides the following pricing options:\n- Free Tier\n-\nYou can get started with Amazon EC2 for free. To explore the Free Tier options, see AWS Free Tier\n.\n- On-Demand Instances\n-\nPay for the instances that you use by the second, with a minimum of 60 seconds, with no long-term commitments or upfront payments.\n- Savings Plans\n-\nYou can reduce your Amazon EC2 costs by making a commitment to a consistent amount of usage, in USD per hour, for a term of 1 or 3 years.\n- Reserved Instances\n-\nYou can reduce your Amazon EC2 costs by making a commitment to a specific instance configuration, including instance type and Region, for a term of 1 or 3 years.\n- Spot Instances\n-\nRequest unused EC2 instances, which can reduce your Amazon EC2 costs significantly.\n- Dedicated Hosts\n-\nReduce costs by using a physical EC2 server that is fully dedicated for your use, either On-Demand or as part of a Savings Plan. You can use your existing server-bound software licenses and get help meeting compliance requirements.\n- On-Demand Capacity Reservations\n-\nReserve compute capacity for your EC2 instances in a specific Availability Zone for any duration of time.\n- Per-second billing\n-\nRemoves the cost of unused minutes and seconds from your bill.\nFor a complete list of charges and prices for Amazon EC2 and more information about the purchase\nmodels, see Amazon EC2 pricing\nEstimates, billing, and cost optimization\nTo create estimates for your AWS use cases, use the AWS Pricing Calculator\nTo estimate the cost of transforming Microsoft\nworkloads to a modern architecture that uses open source and\ncloud-native services deployed on AWS, use the AWS\nModernization Calculator for Microsoft Workloads\nTo see your bill, go to the Billing and Cost Management\nDashboard in the AWS Billing and Cost Management\nconsole\nIf you have questions concerning AWS billing, accounts, and events, contact AWS Support\nTo calculate the cost of a sample provisioned\nenvironment, see Cloud Economics\nCenter\nYou can optimize the cost, security, and performance of your AWS environment\nusing AWS Trusted Advisor\nYou can use AWS Cost Explorer to analyze the cost and usage of your EC2 instances.
