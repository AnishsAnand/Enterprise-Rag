AWS will only bill an account that's associated with running resources.\nNext, review listed scenarios. If you reviewed the scenarios and still can't determine the cause of the charges, then contact AWS Support. Use the AWS billing or account support form, even if you don't have, or can't access, an AWS account.\nImportant: AWS Support can only discuss any account-related information if you're authenticated through Support Center.\nAn account's AWS Free Tier expired\nIf you used the AWS Free Tier and it expired, then some resources might still be active. You're billed for active resources at on-demand rates. For more information, see How do I avoid future charges when I use the AWS Free Tier?\nSomeone in your organization created the account\nCheck whether other authorized users of your credit card used the credit card to open an account. If you use a corporate credit card, then check with the technical department within your organization. Common users of AWS include application or service developers, website designers, and systems administrators.\nA contractor or third party used AWS to provide you with a service\nA contractor or third party that you hired might use AWS to build your website or application. Contact the contractor or third party for more details about the charges.\nSomeone used your payment method without your permission\nIf you own the payment method and don't have an account, then someone might be using your payment information without permission. If you're not associated with the account, then AWS Support can't resolve the charges.\nContact your credit card issuer to dispute the charges or report a stolen credit card.\nRelated information\nHow do I sign in to my AWS account if my credentials don't work?\nUnderstanding unexpected charges"
