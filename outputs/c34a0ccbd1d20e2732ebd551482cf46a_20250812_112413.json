As the longest-running Gartner Magic Quadrant Leader for Cloud Infrastructure and Platform Services, AWS has been recognized for 12 consecutive years, and is helping organizations like Lyft, Netflix, Coca-Cola, and Moderna lower infrastructure costs and accelerate innovation on the world's most reliable, secure, and capable cloud.\nBenefits of AWS Compute\nRight compute for your workloads\nAWS offers the broadest and deepest functionality for compute. Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2) offers granular control for managing your infrastructure with the choice of processors, storage, and networking. AWS container services offer the best choice and flexibility of services to run your containers. AWS Lambda enables you to run code in response to events from more than 150 natively integrated AWS and software as a service (SaaS) sources.\nFrom idea to market, faster\nAWS provides multiple ways to build, deploy, and get to market quickly on the latest technology. The AWS Nitro System, exclusive to AWS, enables us to rapidly innovate, which means you’re always building on the latest technologies. Get started quickly with Amazon Lightsail, a virtual private server for a low, predictable price, and serverless computing with AWS Lambda.\nSecurity, built in\nAWS offers significantly more security, compliance, and governance services, and key features than the next largest cloud provider. With the AWS Nitro System, security is built in at the chip level to continuously monitor, protect, and verify the instance hardware and minimize potential attack surfaces. AWS also supports more security standards and certifications than any other cloud provider, including PCI-DSS, HIPAA/HITECH, FedRAMP, GDPR, FIPS 140-2, and NIST800-171.\nFlexibility to optimize costs\nWith AWS compute you pay only for the instance or resource you need, for as long as you use it, without requiring long-term contracts or complex licensing. We offer automated recommendations to help you improve price performance as well as tools and innovative pricing models to further optimize costs. With EC2 Spot Instances you can save up to 90 percent over on-demand pricing for instances, or with Savings Plans you can save up to 72 percent across instances, containers, and serverless on a single bill.\nCompute where you need it\nAWS is the only cloud provider that distributes a consistent set of services from the cloud, to your data center, to the edge. AWS Outposts extends AWS infrastructure, services, APIs, and tools to any facility. Amazon Elastic Container Service (ECS) Anywhere and Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service (EKS) Anywhere let you run containers on premises using the same APIs and cluster management that you use in the cloud. AWS Wavelength enables you to run applications using AWS Infrastructure and services in AWS telco partners’ data centers to meet your low latency, data residency, and resiliency needs.\nAWS Compute\n750+instances for virtually every business need\n80%of all containerized applications running in the cloud run on AWS\n84%of all Kubernetes workloads in the cloud run on AWS\n108Availability Zones that are multiple, physically separated, and isolated\nLongest-running Magic Quadrant Leader for SCPS\nGartner has recognized AWS as a Magic Quadrant Leader for Strategic Cloud Platform Services for the 13th straight year. AWS placed highest in the Ability to Execute axis of measurement among the eight vendors named in the report.\nRead the Gartner Report\nAWS Compute services\n|\nCategory\n|\nService description\n|\nAWS service\n|\nInstances (Virtual machines)\n|\nEasy-to-use service for deploying and scaling web applications and services\n|\nAWS Elastic Beanstalk - Run and manage web apps.\n|\nInstances (virtual machines)\n|\nSecure and resizable compute capacity (virtual servers) in the cloud\n|\nAmazon Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2) - Secure and resizable compute capacity in the cloud.

The AWS Nitro System enables AWS to innovate faster, further reducing cost for our customers, and deliver added benefits like increased security and new instance types. AWS has completely re-imagined our virtualization infrastructure. Traditionally, hypervisors protect the physical hardware and BIOS, virtualize the CPU, storage, and networking, and provide a rich set of management capabilities. With the Nitro System, we are able to break apart those functions, offload them to dedicated hardware and software, and reduce our costs by delivering all of the resources of a server to customers.\nThe Nitro System is comprised of three main parts: The Nitro Cards are a family of cards that offloads and accelerates I/O for functions including Amazon Virtual Private Cloud (VPC), Amazon Elastic Block Store (EBS), and Amazon EC2 instance storage, ultimately increasing overall system performance. The Nitro Security Chip enables the most secure cloud platform with a minimized attack surface as virtualization and security functions are offloaded to dedicated hardware and software. Additionally, a locked-down security model prohibits all administrative access, including those of Amazon employees, eliminating the possibility of human error and tampering. The Nitro Hypervisor is a lightweight hypervisor that manages memory and CPU allocation and delivers performance that is indistinguishable from bare metal.\nCustomers\nExpedia\nExpedia Group is all in on AWS, with plans to migrate 80 percent of its mission-critical apps from its on-premises data centers to the cloud in the next two to three years. By using AWS, Expedia Group has become more resilient. Expedia Group’s developers have been able to innovate faster while saving the company millions of dollars.\nLyft\nLyft uses AWS to move faster as a company and manage its exponential growth, leveraging AWS products to support more than 100 microservices that enhance every element of its customers’ experience.\nModerna\n\"With AWS, our researchers have the ability to quickly design and execute research experiments and rapidly uncover new insights to get potentially life-saving treatments into production faster... AWS's breadth and depth of services are supporting our mission to create a new generation of medicines for patients and are instrumental in our quest to develop a vaccine for COVID-19 and other life-threatening diseases.\"\nStéphane Bancel\nModerna, CEO\nRobot\nThe AWS serverless architecture and the ease of use of the AWS services inside it free up developer time to produce business value.\nRedfin\nBy using AWS, Redfin can innovate quickly and cost effectively with a small IT staff while managing billions of property records.\nVolkswagen\n\"Management was easy—it was very simple to upload a machine to the platform and simply adjust sizing according to need afterwards\"\nSadao Matsuda\nSAP IT Manager, VWCO\nEasy to migrate and build apps\nAWS provides multiple ways to get you started quickly and easily.
