  "text": "What is Red Hat OpenShift Service on AWS?\nRed Hat OpenShift Service on AWS (ROSA) is a managed service that you can use to build, scale, and deploy containerized applications with the Red Hat OpenShift enterprise Kubernetes platform on AWS. ROSA streamlines moving on-premises Red Hat OpenShift workloads to AWS, and offers tight integration with other AWS services.\nFeatures\nROSA is jointly supported and operated by AWS and Red Hat. Each ROSA cluster comes with 24-hour Red Hat site reliability engineer (SRE) support for cluster management, backed by Red Hat’s 99.95% uptime service-level agreement (SLA). For more information about the service’s support model, see Getting ROSA support.\nROSA also provides the following features:\n-\nRed Hat SRE-supported cluster installation, cluster maintenance, and cluster upgrades.\n-\nAWS service integrations include AWS compute, database, analytics, machine learning, networking, and mobile.\n-\nRun and scale the Kubernetes control plane across multiple AWS Availability Zones to ensure high availability.\n-\nOperate clusters using OpenShift APIs and developer productivity tools, including Service Mesh, CodeReady Workspaces, and Serverless.\nAccessing ROSA\nYou can define and configure your ROSA service deployments using the following interfaces.\nAWS\n-\nROSA console — Provides a web interface to enable the ROSA subscription and purchase a ROSA software contract.\n-\nAWS Command Line Interface (AWS CLI) — Provides commands for a broad set of AWS services and is supported on Windows, macOS, and Linux. For more information, see AWS Command Line Interface\n.\nRed Hat OpenShift\n-\nRed Hat Hybrid Cloud Console — Provides a web interface to create, update, and manage ROSA clusters, install cluster add-ons, and create and deploy applications to a ROSA cluster.\n-\nROSA CLI (rosa) — Provides commands to create, update, and manage ROSA clusters.\n-\nOpenShift CLI (oc) — Provides commands to create applications and manage OpenShift Container Platform projects.\n-\nKnative CLI (kn) - Provides commands that can be used to interact with OpenShift Serverless components, such as Knative Serving and Eventing.\n-\nPipelines CLI (tkn) - Provides commands to interact with OpenShift Pipelines using the terminal.\n-\nopm CLI - Provides commands that help Operator developers and cluster administrators create and maintain OpenShift Operator catalogs from the terminal.\n-\nOperator SDK CLI - Provides commands that an Operator developer can use to build, test, and deploy an OpenShift operator.\nHow to get started with ROSA\nThe following summarizes the getting started process for ROSA. For detailed getting started instructions, see Get started with ROSA.\nAWS Management Console/AWS CLI\n-\nConfigure permissions for AWS services that ROSA relies on to deliver service functionality. For more information, see Prerequisites.\n-\nInstall and configure the latest AWS CLI tool. For more information, see Installing our updating the latest version of the AWS CLI in the AWS CLI User Guide.\n-\nEnable ROSA in the ROSA console\n.\nRed Hat Hybrid Cloud Console/ROSA CLI\n-\nDownload the latest version of the ROSA CLI and OpenShift CLI from the Red Hat Hybrid Cloud Console\n. For more information, see Getting started with the ROSA CLI in the Red Hat documentation.\n-\nCreate ROSA clusters in the Red Hat Hybrid Cloud Console or with the ROSA CLI.\n-\nWhen your cluster is ready, configure an identity provider to grant user access to the cluster.\n-\nDeploy and manage workloads on your ROSA cluster the same way that you would with any other OpenShift environment.\nPricing\nThe total cost of ROSA consists of two components: ROSA service fees and AWS infrastructure fees. For more information about pricing, see Red Hat OpenShift Service on AWS Pricing\nROSA service fees\nBy default, ROSA service fees accrue on demand at an hourly rate per 4 vCPU used by worker nodes. Service fees are uniform across all supported AWS standard Regions. In addition to the worker node service fee, ROSA with hosted control planes (HCP) clusters incur an hourly cluster fee.\nROSA offers 1-year and 3-year service fee contracts that you can purchase for savings on the on-demand service fees for worker nodes. For more information, see Purchasing a ROSA contract.\nAWS infrastructure fees\nAWS infrastructure fees apply to the underlying worker nodes, infrastructure nodes, control plane nodes, storage, and network resources hosted on AWS global infrastructure. AWS infrastructure fees vary by AWS Region.",
