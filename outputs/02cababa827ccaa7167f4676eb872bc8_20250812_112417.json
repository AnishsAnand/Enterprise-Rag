You'll find easy-to-understand info about broad topics such as \"What is Machine Learning?\" and \"What is Data Science?\" These articles are intended to help you up-level your understanding of frequently asked cloud computing topics.\nMost popular cloud computing concepts\nWhat is AI?\nArtificial intelligence (AI) is the field of computer science dedicated to solving cognitive problems commonly associated with human intelligence, such as learning, creation, and image recognition. Modern organizations collect large volumes of data from diverse sources like smart sensors, human-generated content, monitoring tools, and system logs. The goal with AI is to create self-learning systems that derive meaning from data. Then, AI can apply that knowledge to solve new problems in human-like ways.\nWhat is Prompt Engineering?\nPrompt engineering is the process where you guide generative AI, which requires detailed instructions, solutions to generate desired outputs. In prompt engineering, you choose the most appropriate formats, phrases, words, and symbols that guide the AI to interact with your users more meaningfully. Prompt engineers use creativity plus trial and error to create a collection of input texts, so an application's generative AI works as expected.\nWhat is Generative AI?\nGenerative artificial intelligence is a type of AI that can create new content and ideas, including conversations, stories, images, videos, and music. AI technologies attempt to mimic human intelligence in nontraditional computing tasks like image recognition, natural language processing (NLP), and translation. Generative AI can be trained to learn human language, programming languages, or any complex subject matter. It reuses training data to solve new problems. Generative AI can be used for various purposes, like chatbots, media creation, and product development and design.\nWhat is Conversational AI?\nConversational artificial intelligence is a technology that makes software capable of understanding and responding to voice-based or text-based human conversations. Conversational AI goes beyond the traditional human chat with software which has been limited to preprogrammed inputs where users enter or speak predetermined commands. Conversational AI can recognize all types of speech and text input, mimic human interactions, and understand and respond to queries in various languages.\nBrowse all cloud computing concepts\nBrowse all cloud computing concepts content here:\nLearn more about cloud comparisons\nThe Cloud Comparisons page features content that helps readers understand common use cases for when to use one cloud solution or another.
