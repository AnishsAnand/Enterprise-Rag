  "text": "What is Amazon Elastic Container Registry?\nAmazon Elastic Container Registry (Amazon ECR) is an AWS managed container image registry service that is secure, scalable, and reliable. Amazon ECR supports private repositories with resource-based permissions using AWS IAM. This is so that specified users or Amazon EC2 instances can access your container repositories and images. You can use your preferred CLI to push, pull, and manage Docker images, Open Container Initiative (OCI) images, and OCI compatible artifacts.\nNote\nAmazon ECR supports public container image repositories as well. For more information, see What is Amazon ECR Public in the Amazon ECR Public User Guide.\nThe AWS container services team maintains a public roadmap on GitHub. It contains\ninformation about what the teams are working on and allows all AWS customers the ability\nto give direct feedback. For more information, see AWS Containers Roadmap\nFeatures of Amazon ECR\nAmazon ECR provides the following features:\n-\nLifecycle policies help with managing the lifecycle of the images in your repositories. You define rules that result in the cleaning up of unused images. You can test rules before applying them to your repository. For more information, see Automate the cleanup of images by using lifecycle policies in Amazon ECR.\n-\nImage scanning helps in identifying software vulnerabilities in your container images. Each repository can be configured to scan on push. This ensures that each new image pushed to the repository is scanned. You can then retrieve the results of the image scan. For more information, see Scan images for software vulnerabilities in Amazon ECR.\n-\nCross-Region and cross-account replication makes it easier for you to have your images where you need them. This is configured as a registry setting and is on a per-Region basis. For more information, see Private registry settings in Amazon ECR.\n-\nPull through cache rules provide a way to cache repositories in an upstream registry in your private Amazon ECR registry. Using a pull through cache rule, Amazon ECR will periodically reach out to the upstream registry to ensure the cached image in your Amazon ECR private registry is up to date. For more information, see Sync an upstream registry with an Amazon ECR private registry.\nHow to get started with Amazon ECR\nIf you are using Amazon Elastic Container Service (Amazon ECS) or Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service (Amazon EKS), note that the setup for those two services is similar to the setup for Amazon ECR because Amazon ECR is an extension of both services.\nWhen using the AWS Command Line Interface with Amazon ECR, use a version of the AWS CLI that supports the latest Amazon ECR features. If you don't see support for an Amazon ECR feature in the AWS CLI, upgrade to the latest version of the AWS CLI. For information about installing the latest version of the AWS CLI, see Install or update to the latest version of the AWS CLI in the AWS Command Line Interface User Guide.\nTo learn how to push a container image to a private Amazon ECR repository using the AWS CLI and Docker, see Moving an image through its lifecycle in Amazon ECR.\nPricing for Amazon ECR\nWith Amazon ECR, you only pay for the amount of data you store in your repositories and for\nthe data transfer from your image pushes and pulls.
